# Answering Questions on Piazza

## Notifications

We work hard to encourage students to ask a lot of questions on Piazza, so we need to back it up by maintaining a relatively low average response time.

**To this end, I recommend changing the default email notification settings from "Digest" to "Real-time", and auto-follow all threads.** Piazza forces you to do this for every new section, rather than remembering your last choice.

You could also download Piazza's mobile app for your phone and set up Push Notifications, if you prefer.

## Blockers

I break down questions into two categories: blockers vs non-blockers.

Blockers are logistical or basic conceptual questions that, until answered, will completely stall a student. Since our students often only have one or two evenings per week that they carve out for homework, **it's essential to try and answer blockers as soon as possible** \(and ensure that other students don't incorrectly answer them\). This why we bother to set up notifications as described above.

Non-blockers are questions that are not essential to completing the homework, and we can leave these unanswered for longer and allow students to have a chance to answer them for one another.

## Escalation

There will oftentimes be questions that you aren't 100% sure how to answer, especially considering the unconventional beginner-flavored version of Ruby and Rails that we teach.

If you see a question that you're not sure how to answer, **the important thing is to escalate the question by mentioning it in Slack** to draw other instructors' attention to it. You should feel free to take a stab at answering; others can expand on/edit your answer if needed.

## Markdown Here

Piazza's text editor is horrible, especially for code.

The best partial solution I've found is to use the [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/) Chrome extension. This will allow inline code with backticks, and all other Markdown goodness. (I use this extension for writing emails, too.)

One flaw is that, on Piazza, you have to manually add linebreaks after each paragraph _after_ converting the Markdown to Rich Text.
