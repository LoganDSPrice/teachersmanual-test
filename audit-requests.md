# Audit Requests

"Hi xxxxxx,

I'm afraid we can't accommodate requests to sit in, just due to the sheer volume of them.

Your best bet is to try to register. If you are unable to get in, then attend the first session anyway -- quite a few people drop the first week after they see how much work it's going to be.

If you're still unable to land a spot, and if you won't have an opportunity to try again in the future, then we can think about options. We're considering publishing a Coursera course this summer, for one.

Good luck,

Raghu"
