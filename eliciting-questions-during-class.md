# Eliciting Questions During Class

At all times during class when you're not [actively pair teaching](pair-teaching.md), you should be on your feet, walking around, and looking over students shoulders.

 - Preventing setup issues before they happen.
 - Make announcements if you see common errors.
 - Letting the driver know when 80% of students have gotten 80% of the way through a lab, so it's time to move on.
 - Most importantly: **eliciting questions**. Not just waiting for students to raise their hands; you will increase the volume of questions tenfold if you walk nearby them slowly, or ask "How's it going?" Almost everyone has something they want to talk about.
 
**There is almost never a time when you should be on your laptop unless you are fixing something time-sensitive.**
