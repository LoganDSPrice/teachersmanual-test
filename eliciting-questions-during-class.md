# Eliciting Questions During Class

You should not be on your laptop during class unless you are doing something directly class-related that can't be done after class.

You should be walking around and looking over students shoulders, eliciting questions, catching common errors and letting the driver know, letting the driver know when it's safe to move on from a lab or if more time is needed, etc.
