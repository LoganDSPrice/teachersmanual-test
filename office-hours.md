# Office Hours

One-on-one conversations during office hours are a crucial element of learning.

I use youcanbook.me for scheduling and set it up to open two 2-hour blocks of 20 minute slots one week in advance. If both 2-hour blocks fill up, then I'll open up a third.

In general, try not to leave students hanging — they should walk away from an office hours appointment with most of the questions that they came in with answered. Remember our goal here is not to produce professional developers, so be deliberate about leaving them with open questions to struggle with.

It is good to give them new things to think about, however, and then have them book another appointment to discuss after they've done some work — e.g. researching an API for their project.
