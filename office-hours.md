# Office Hours

One-on-one conversations during office hours are a crucial element of learning.

## Setup your calendar

I'm assuming you have a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) account.

 - Click the gear icon to get to "Settings".
 - In the left sidebar, click "Add calendar" > "New Calendar".
 - Name the new calendar "[YOUR NAME]'s AppDev" (or whatever you prefer).
 - Configure your new calendar (click on its name in the left sidebar).
    - Share with specific people — me, `rbetina@gmail.com`. Allow me to make changes and manage sharing.
    - I usually add a default notification of 10 minutes for myself, but that's up to you. 
 - Exit settings and return to the calendar.
 - Create a new event called "Office hours" (spelling and capitalization matter):
    - Make sure you created the event in the new AppDev calendar you created earlier. If not, edit the event and switch it.
    - Edit the event and switch the availability to "Free" if it says "Busy".
    - I usually make each block of office hours last for two hours.
        - Students have the option of booking for 20 minutes (default) or 40 minutes, so this means 4-5 students per block.
    - I usually open two 2-hour blocks per week. I will then open more if students post on Piazza that they can't find open slots. 
    - Make the event re-occurring if you want to, until the end of the quarter.
 - Students can now book you at [https://appdevofficehours.youcanbook.me](https://appdevofficehours.youcanbook.me) and a booking will automatically appear in your Google Calendar. Try it out yourself.
 
In general, try not to leave students hanging — they should walk away from an office hours appointment with most of the questions that they came in with answered. Remember our goal here is not to produce professional developers, so be deliberate about leaving them with open questions to struggle with.

It is good to give them new things to think about, however, and then have them book another appointment to discuss after they've done some work — e.g. researching an API for their project.
