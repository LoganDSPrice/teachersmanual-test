# Setting Up GitHub

> Do I signup for a class organization, select team (starts at $25/month) supply credit card info, etc.  BEFORE I request education discount, OR signup for a free org, then ask for discount, and then I can promote to Team.   I am assuming we want a Team organization that allows private repos â€” correct? 

Sign up for a free org, then request a discount here:
