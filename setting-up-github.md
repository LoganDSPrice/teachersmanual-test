# Setting Up GitHub

> Do I signup for a class organization, select team \(starts at $25/month\) supply credit card info, etc. BEFORE I request education discount, OR signup for a free org, then ask for discount, and then I can promote to Team. I am assuming we want a Team organization that allows private repos â€” correct?

Sign up for a free org, then request a discount here:

## Remove application restrictions
